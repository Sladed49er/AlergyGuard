### 🔑 Environment Variables Set

```env
# Database (Supabase)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://..."  # Using connection pooling

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="[generated-secret]"

# Still Needed:
OPENAI_API_KEY=""  # For AI features
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=""  # For Google OAuth (optional)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=""  # For Google OAuth (optional)
```

### 🚀 Immediate Next Steps for AI Integration

1. **Get OpenAI API Key**
   - Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
   - Create a new API key
   - Add to `.env`: `OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."`

2. **Create AI Service Module**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p lib/services
   touch lib/services/openai.ts
   ```

3. **Key AI Features to Implement**
   - **Meal Planning**: Generate weekly meal plans avoiding specific allergens
   - **Recipe Analysis**: Scan recipes for hidden allergens
   - **Restaurant Menu Analysis**: Upload menu photos for allergen detection
   - **Ingredient Substitutions**: Suggest safe alternatives
   - **Emergency Response Guidance**: AI-powered emergency action plans

### 📋 Development Roadmap Update

#### Phase 1: Core Profile Management (Next Session Priority)
- [ ] Create profile add/edit pages
- [ ] Allergy management (add/edit/delete)
- [ ] Severity levels and symptoms
- [ ] Emergency contact management
- [ ] Family member relationships

#### Phase 2: AI Integration (High Priority)
- [ ] OpenAI API setup
- [ ] Meal planning generator
- [ ] Recipe analyzer
- [ ] Ingredient scanner (photo upload)
- [ ] Safe food recommendations

#### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Restaurant integration
- [ ] Barcode scanning
- [ ] Medical provider sharing
- [ ] Reaction tracking
- [ ] Symptom diary

### 💡 AI Implementation Strategy

1. **OpenAI Integration Points**
   ```typescript
   // lib/services/openai.ts
   - analyzeMealPlan(allergies: string[], preferences: string[])
   - checkRecipeForAllergens(recipe: string, allergies: string[])
   - suggestSubstitutions(ingredient: string, allergies: string[])
   - generateEmergencyPlan(allergy: string, severity: string)
   ```

2. **Prompt Engineering Needed**
   - Meal planning prompts that consider cross-contamination
   - Recipe analysis with hidden ingredient detection
   - Cultural/dietary preference accommodation
   - Age-appropriate meal suggestions

3. **Safety Considerations**
   - Always include disclaimer about medical advice
   - Implement confidence scoring for AI suggestions
   - Allow user verification of AI recommendations
   - Store AI interaction history for improvement

### 🎯 For the Next Session

**What to tell the AI assistant:**

"I'm building AllergyGuard, an allergy management app. I've completed the authentication system with NextAuth, database setup with Prisma and Supabase, and have a working registration/login flow. The dashboard shows user profiles. 

I need to implement the AI features using OpenAI. The main priorities are:
1. Setting up OpenAI integration
2. Creating profile management pages (add/edit profiles and allergies)
3. Building the AI-powered meal planner
4. Implementing recipe analysis for allergen detection

Here's my handoff document: [share HANDOFF-AUTH-COMPLETE.md]

I have an OpenAI API key ready: [provide if you have one]

The project is at ~/Development/AllergyGuard on my Mac."

### 🔧 Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/Development/AllergyGuard

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open VS Code
code .

# View database
npx prisma studio

# If needed, regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

### 📊 Database Schema Reminder

**Current Tables:**
- User (id, email, name, password, image)
- Profile (id, userId, name, relationship, dateOfBirth)
- Allergy (id, profileId, allergen, severity, symptoms, notes)
- EmergencyContact (id, profileId, name, phone, relationship)
- MealPlan (id, profileId, name, meals, dates)

**Relationships:**
- User → many Profiles
- Profile → many Allergies
- Profile → many EmergencyContacts
- Profile → many MealPlans

### ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Test Account Created**
   - Email: matt@slade.guru
   - Has one profile (self)
   - Ready for testing

2. **Security Implemented**
   - Passwords are hashed with bcrypt
   - Sessions managed by NextAuth
   - Protected routes require authentication

3. **Next Major Milestone**
   - Get AI working for meal planning
   - This is the app's key differentiator
   - Focus on safety and accuracy
